After reading the Economist article, I was struck by the estimated decrease in
crashes and motor deaths if we move to self-driving cars. It is hard for me
to believe these numbers and it seems highly unlikely that they know exactly how
hundreds of these vehicles will interact on the road. Yet, the idea is incredibly
interesting and could bring a dawn in transportation. I would be willing to live
in the envisioned scenario, however I do hope the ability to buy and own a car that
I can drive does not go away entirely. I think big cities will adopt this strategy
relatively early and will initiate the movement. Society as a whole may not
be very willing to adopt this scenario for many years. Then again, millennials could
single handedly push society into a new age.

"The net effect of the gain in computer skill is thus, ironically, a gain in human skill.
Humans—at least the best ones—are getting better at playing chess."

I think something computers have made and will make humans better at something that humans have
traditionally been better at is driving. Computers have already been implemented in airplanes
and now airplanes are flown by a combination of human and computer. The computer is able
to calculate extremely far in the future and detect things humans might not have thought about.
The ability for machine to make man smarter and better able to drive cars is right
around the corner. Just like in the chess example, the computer will be able to calculate events
far in advance and help humans avoid accidents and save time.

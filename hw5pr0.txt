1. The researcher needed to show that the water computer could compute
in a synchronized way. Computer programs execute several simultaneous operations
conducted in a step by step manner, the clock enables them to start and stop
correctly.

2. In my opinion, the physical matter the biological computer is manipulating
is physical matter. Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen molecules, which can
be found in many physical substances. The question is murkier for me when I think
about what is truly a biological organism, but in so far as water is physical matter
I agree this computer can move physical matter.

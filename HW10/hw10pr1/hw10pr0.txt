I got 4 out of 6 correct. For the most part it is hard to tell the
difference between the machine and a real human poet. I think automatic
authoring is a negative development for certain reasons, but positive for others.
I think news reporting becomes really easy using machines, but I don't like the
idea that machines can create the same level of artistic works such as fictional
books and poems. I also don't think that machines are sophisticated enough yet to produce
such artistic endeavors.

I would describe the set of ideas as infinite. I would make the distinction
that the number of ideas is uncountable as a result of things that can not be
perceived because they don't already exist. If a new idea can be articulated at some
point in the future, but at the current moment in time it does not exist, there
are in essence unlimited and uncountable combinations of new ideas.

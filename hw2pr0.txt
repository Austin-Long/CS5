The most interesting idea in the article is Watson's ability to process natural
language. Natural language processing is a complex idea and I love
to learn about advances in this area. I don't think Watson's capabilities will
make a big impact on any advanced quantitative prediction methods used in Finance.
I think it could have an interesting impact on information translation into other
human languages. Watson style is similar to human style in that it parses through
the sometimes cryptic Jeopardy questions. However, it differs in its ability to
always understand that words can be used in several ways. The nuances of the
language seem hard to code into Watson.

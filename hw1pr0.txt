2) The article states that, whether in science or business, we "don't have to settle for models at all."
Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more
nuanced or hybrid view, if you'd like.

I agree with the article, models have become obsolete for analyzing big data problems. You do not need to understand the
underlying model in order to use a statistical algorithm to best predict ad spend based on millions of data points. I will
argue that understanding the underlying model can sometimes make a solution more accessible, but it is not always
necessary. In certain situations, the customer may not be comfortable with just letting the machine churn out a result.
I would predict we are not far away from advanced statistical learning becoming the backbone of just about every
successful business.

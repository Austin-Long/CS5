I think we are in a simulation in a sense that humans are always trying
new things, searching for new ways to interpret everything around us. In a sense,
this reality we know is one simulation out of thousands. Many humans before us
tried and failed at making a plane, now I ride on planes everywhere in the world.
This would not drastically change my view of the world because I still want the
same things for myself and for all humans.

Hopper states two disadvantages:
  1. Some time is lost in completing duplicate data transfers
  2. If the function you want does not exist you have to create it and add it to a library

I would say these drawbacks still exist, but certainly not to the same extent they did
when the paper was written. Today, they are significantly less important because so many
functions and packages exist allowing us to not have to duplicate code. The first problem still
exists and may improve in time.

An advantage of using a language like Python that Hopper does not list is ease of syntax.
Functions have become incredibly easier to read and write because of these higher level languages.
